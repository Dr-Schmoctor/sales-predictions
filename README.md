Analyzing data from sales can be a overwhelming when the data sets are large and dirty. However, this project takes a dataset from below to clean, analyze and present a conclusion from the data provided.

## Data Source
```

```
This dataset contains 8523 Rows, 12 Columns

## Data Dictionary

**To prepare this project, the data was inspected and cleaned before analysis.**

## Exploratory Analysis
For the exploratory analysis:
- a boxplot and histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column
- a barplot was visualized for each categorical column. 
- Each visual was inspected and a description was added of the analysis.

* This histogram represents our total outlet sales per item. We can see that the majority of our sales are below the 4k line. However we did analyze this further by comparing the outlet sales per item.

* This shows that the median outlet sale for all of our Item Types is similar. The data shows that several of the item-types have higher end outliers that are influencing the data.

* We also analyze the volume of each item_type in our data set. This shows a significant skew towards Fruits and Vegetables, Snack Foods and Household for Item_Types.
